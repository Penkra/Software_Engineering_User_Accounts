To use user accounts, you have to have an html file and add 4 lines in the head tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://se.penkra.com/style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Manrope">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://se.penkra.com/apis/account.js"></script>
 
Line 1: The link to the CSS styling for the system.
Line 2: The link to a custom Google font called Manrope
Line 3: The link to include jQuery (Line 4 depends on jQuery)
Line 4: The link to the user accounts javascript API

Adding those 4 lines alone to any html will transform any HTML to:

No special requirement is needed
Any text editor capable of creating and editing HTML will work
Also, internet connection is necessary
